# advent-of-code-2023
Let's try to do the advent of code 2023 in Java 21

It's not the first time I tried, but I never complete one, so this year in order to ty to complete it,
I will only do the first part of each challenge in hope it wil not take too much time.

Each code is contained in one file, by example for the day 1, you can just run
```bash
java src/main/java/AdventOfCode01.java
```

- [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1) [AdventOfCode01.java](src/main/java/AdventOfCode01.java)
- [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2) [AdventOfCode02.java](src/main/java/AdventOfCode02.java)
- [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3) [AdventOfCode03.java](src/main/java/AdventOfCode03.java)
- [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4) [AdventOfCode04.java](src/main/java/AdventOfCode04.java)

Each code will be published the day after.

Enjoy
